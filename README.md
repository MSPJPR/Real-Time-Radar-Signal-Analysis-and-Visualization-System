Project Overview

Title

Real-Time Radar Signal Analysis and Visualization System

Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to develop a web-based application that simulates radar signal analysis, allowing users to visualize radar signals, detect targets, and understand radar parameters through an interactive interface. This project aims to provide insights into radar technology, signal processing, and target detection in a user-friendly manner.

Key Features

1. User Input for Signal Parameters:

Users can input radar signal parameters such as frequency and pulse width through a simple form.



2. Simulated Target Detection:

The system simulates the detection of multiple radar targets with random distances and velocities, demonstrating how radar systems work in real time.



3. Waveform Visualization:

A textual representation of the generated radar signal waveform is provided, allowing users to understand the relationship between frequency, pulse width, and the resulting signal.



4. Dynamic Target List:

The application displays a list of detected targets with their distances and velocities, helping users grasp the concept of target tracking in radar systems.



5. Responsive Web Interface:

The project is developed as a web application using Flask, making it accessible from any device with a web browser. The design is responsive, ensuring usability on mobile devices like the Moto G45.



6. CSS Styling:

The application employs CSS for a visually appealing layout, enhancing user experience with clear, structured information and smooth animations.




Technical Stack

Frontend:

HTML/CSS for layout and styling

JavaScript for handling user interactions and making asynchronous requests to the backend


Backend:

Flask, a Python web framework, for handling requests and serving the application



Potential Applications
